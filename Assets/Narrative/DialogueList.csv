1,Father,"Did you hear that noise, darling?"
2,Mother,"Yes, honey, I wonder what little Timmy is up to now."
3,Father,"Let’s go have a look, make sure it isn’t anything serious, like him turning his bedroom into a mess again."
4,Mother,"Oh honey, you and your jokes. I really did end up marrying a jokester, huh? (giggles)"
5,Narration,(Parents proceed to Timmy’s bedroom)
6,Narration,"(Both parents arrive at Timmy’s room, his door is already open)"
7,Narration,"(Father and Mother stare in disbelief at their ‘joke’ of a manifestation. At the foothold of their gaze, a small five year old boy busy playing with his toys.)"
8,Father,…
9,Mother,…
10,Narration,"(Timmy notices his parents looking at the mess he made in his bedroom. He knows just as well as they do, that this isn’t good. But what if, Timmy could find a way out of trouble? What if Timmy could find someone else to blame for his messy room?)"
11,Narration,"(Timmy looks at Teddy, his favorite teddy bear, sleeping peacefully under the bed.)"
12,Timmy,(Points at Teddy) Teddy Did It!
13,Father,"What??? Stop making up stories, you owe us an explanation! (slight anger behind his voice, raised)"
14,Mother,"Honey, there’s no need to be angry, why not let Timmy tell us what happened. You’ll do that for us, right my little pumpkin?"
15,Mother,"(directly talking to Timmy and addressing him as ‘little pumpkin’, trying to deflate the scenario)"
16,Timmy,(nods)
17,Father,…
18,Mother,Mother:
19,Narration,…
20,Narration,…
21,Narration,…
22,Timmy,"Teddy made a mess out of everything, I was just trying to tidy up my room!"
23,Father,Playing with toys is considered ‘tidying up’?
24,Mother,Honey…
25,Father,I fear that side-eye more than anything…
26,Father,…
27,Timmy,"I haven’t been playing with Teddy recently, so he got really upset with me and decided to make a mess out of my room."
28,Mother,"Oh dear, that’s horrible! The little rascal…"
29,Mother,"I noticed your LEGO’s are all over the place, was that Teddy’s doing as well?"
30,Timmy,Yes!
31,Timmy,Teddy was running around like crazy and bumped into everything
32,Timmy,Know what he did next? He started throwing the LEGO pieces all over my room! That’s why they’re everywhere!
33,Mother,(gasps) ... Your precious LEGO castle you spent so long on building…
34,Mother,What was Teddy doing to it???
35,Timmy,(skeptic) I… I don’t know?
36,Father,There are even LEGO pieces under your bed???
37,Timmy,"Yeah, Teddy threw them all over the place. I don’t know why he was being like that..."
38,Father,(sigh) Give me and Mother a moment to converse real quick…
39,Narration,"(Father & Mother whisper to each other, while Timmy sits on the floor waiting in anticipation)"
40,Narration,"(They finish talking and finally come to a conclusion, what Timmy’s punishment will be.)"
41,Father,"Well, Timmy, what happened to your room is inexcusable. I hope you know that."
42,Mother,"Father is right, pumpkin…"
43,Timmy,…
44,Father,Timmy.
45,Timmy,"Yes, Father…?"
46,Father,Mother and I have decided to ground you from playing on the DX for a week.
47,Mother,"Remember, pumpkin, we’re doing it to teach you a lesson. We want you to take responsibility for what ‘Teddy’ has done, he is your friend after all."
48,Father,Understood?
49,Timmy,"Yes, Father…"
50,Father,"Now get to cleaning this mess up, pronto."
51,Timmy,(nods)
52,Narration,(Father & Mother exit the room and head back downstairs)
53,Timmy,What DID happen to my LEGO castle?
54,Teddy,Teddy: …
55,Teddy,Today is the day.
56,Teddy,I’ve been taking advantage of Timmy’s messy room and his school times.
57,Teddy,"I’ve trained my body and enhanced my skills, all in order to defeat Broccoli King, who resides in his castle, the haunting Vegecastle of Fear."
58,Teddy,"Truth is, I have something worth fighting for."
59,Teddy,"I want to get on Timmy’s good side again, and to my knowledge, the only way I can achieve that is by helping him overcome his veggiephobia. Therefore I have to put Broccoli King’s fearful reign to an end."
60,Teddy,"Timmy knows how important it is for him to eat his veggies, but he lacks the courage to do so. I want to be that courage, I want to be the reason he overcomes his fear"
61,Teddy,"I have to do it, for Timmy, for me, for us"
62,Teddy,"The entrance to the castle, I can see it."
63,Teddy,It’s finally time.
64,Teddy,There’s toys everywhere…
65,Teddy,"Missing socks??? Are you serious right now, Timmy?"
66,Teddy,I feel something brew in me…
67,Teddy,The training has paid off.
68,Teddy,I might get stronger if I break some more LEGO’s…
69,Teddy,"I’m getting close, I can sense his green presence…"
70,Teddy,"I’m almost there… Almost, Timmy…"
71,Teddy,"Finally, I made it…"
72,King,MUHAHAHAHAAHAH
73,King,WHO DARES STAND BEFORE THE MIGHTY BROCCOLI KING???
74,Teddy,Me! I am here to reclaim what is mine.
75,King,HAHAAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHA
76,King,WHAT’S A MERE TEDDY BEAR GOING TO DO? HUG ME TILL I CAN’T BREATHE ANYMORE?
77,King,HAHAHAHAHAHHAAH
78,King,YOU IGNORANT BEAR!
79,Teddy,"Ignorant I may be, scared am I not."
80,King,"TRY ALL YOU WANT, IT’S FUTILE! HAHAHAHAH"
81,Teddy,Let’s see if veggies really do bleed green!
82,Teddy,"I did it… Timmy, I did it…"
83,Teddy,"Hopefully this will manage to help Timmy, and save our friendship."
84,Teddy,"There’s nothing more important in my life, he’s all I have…"
85,Teddy,Ah…
86,Teddy,I’m tired…
87,Teddy,Really… tired
88,Teddy,I have to get back to the bed… before he comes back from school…
89,Teddy,Muster up the last of my remaining strength…
90,Teddy,Ah…
91,Teddy,Where’s Timmy when I need him…
92,Teddy,A hug could do me really well right now…
93,Mother,Awwwwww… is our big boy enjoying his broccoli?
94,Timmy,"Thanks, Mother! It’s delicious!"
95,Timmy,"It really ended up growing on me, not to mention it’s really healthy too!"
96,Father,That’s my boy!
97,Timmy,(quickly finishes his remaining food)
98,Timmy,(Mother notices Timmy is in a hurry)
99,Mother,"Oh? And where are you heading, young man?"
100,Timmy,"Hehe, me and Teddy are busy rebuilding our LEGO castle together! He’s waiting for me to finish eating."
101,Mother,"(smiles) Go on now, don’t make ol’ Teddy wait! I’m sure he’s excited to be able to play with you again!"
102,Timmy,That makes two of us. (soft smile)
103,Narration,(Timmy runs off to his room)
104,Father,He actually managed to finish all of his veggies…
105,Father,MY SMALL BOY IS BECOMING A MAN! (starts crying)
106,Mother,Awww honey….
107,Mother,No need to cry.. (hugs Father)
108,Mother,(softly) From one small boy to another
109,Father,Hm?
110,Mother,"I love you, honey"
111,Father,"(sniffs) I love you too, darling."
